"Argentina","ARG","Sheep","Linca","Español","Patagonia is the main wool production zone in Argentina, concentrating in it the largest national sheep stock (SENASA 2012). This production is based on the Merino breed , which has an almost exclusive role in the region. However, before the first introductions to the country of Merino specimens, the sheep that inhabited the region were used as a source of shelter, food and barter by the local native peoples, which were traded with all kinds of products to and from Chile (Porcel de Peralta, 1965; Palermo, 1998; Mandrini, 1998; Bandieri, 2005). In the nineteenth century and after the independence of the Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata from the Spanish crown, the commercial obstacles existing until now were released, so that agricultural production suffered a great boom, favoring national wool production and imports. of fine wool animals, both coveted by the international market (Giberti, 1961). This, added to the conquest of lands previously inhabited by the native peoples, and the encouragement by the government to populate Patagonia, promotes the peak of sheep production, unleashing a process known as “Merinization”. In this way, the Merino breed was imposing itself, gradually absorbing the pre-existing sheep populations (Arrazcaeta, 1998; Coronato, 2010). Today the Merino breed has an almost exclusive role in the agricultural production of the region, while the Corriedale makes up the production systems of the province of Santa Cruz and Tierra del Fuego, leaving only remnants of the first sheep populations that inhabited it. However, based on work carried out together with artisans from the region, it has been possible to identify that the type of wool most suitable for the development of traditional crafts on the Mapuche loom differs from that demanded by the industry. It comes from ""Creole"" animals regionally known as ""Linca"". The current ""Linca"" population presents scattered and reduced flocks, noting difficulties in the replacement of females and particularly of breeding males.","",""

This breed is considered to have experienced less mixing with other breeds in the last 100 years than with most French breeds.  Originally they were selected primarily for milk production when making their breeding decisions. Due to the habitat of this breed, it was naturally selected for muscling, hardiness and adaptability in order for them to live under range conditions in the French Alps, the result is a dual purpose breed.  Today, the french use the breed solely for milk production and for the making of Beaufort, a Gruyere-type cheese. The average production is 5,500 kilos (12,199 lbs) of milk in a 305 day lactation with no feed concentrates in the summer.  This breed is distinctive for its abundant muscling in the hip region, and they are exceptionally long from hooks to pins. Climbing at high altitudes is what makes their remarkable natural muscling and marbling, as well as endowing the breed with a very robust cardiovascular system. Characteristics  The Tarentaise coat is a tan colour with darkening around the eyes and sometimes on the neck of the bulls, they also have a black nose, udder and hooves. They are of a medium build and well muscled.  A Tarentaise cow is universally recognized for her moderate size, early maturity, large volume of milk and ease of calving. The dark pigmentation of the eyes, feet, and udders guard against pinkeye, cancer eye and sunburn.","Tarentaise",""

The limbs are thin and dry. The hooves have a regular shape and size. The dairy features are expressed very well. The udder is voluminous, trough- or goblet-shaped, widely attached high at the rear part. The teats are of optimal length, usually cylindrical in shape. Normally their tips are dark coloured. The tail is medium long to long, ending in a welloutlined white tuft.

The body structure is proportional. The limbs are normally attached with tough bones, good musculature and a firm hoof horn. The udder is well developed, usually gobletshaped. The hair coat is short. The calves are gray-white at birth. At the age of 2-3-months they become gray-black and latter on they become graybrown. The female animals have an excellent shape of the udder and teats for machine milking. The fat and protein contents are extremely favorable. The male calves are very good for fattening; they have good daily gain and high slaughter output. The breed adapts quickly to various breeding systems and climatic conditions. The animals demonstrate long lifespan and continuous productivity that are very important traits in the evaluation of the breed efficiency.","","Кафяво говедо, Bulgarian Brown Cattle"

In Ecuador, guinea pig breeding is predominantly family and family/commercial, it takes place mainly in the high Andean zone (Ecuadorian highlands) and has spread to the coast and the Amazon; on the other hand, women, in their great majority (80.4%), are in charge of the upbringing; However, in the last decade the consumption of guinea pig meat has been increasing and it is estimated that there is a per capita consumption/year of 3.3 kg. The consumption of guinea pig meat has increased due to its high quality, which is characterized by high protein content (19.3–20.3%) and polyunsaturated fatty acids (6–20%). Finally, studies carried out on the genetics characterization of the guinea pig in South America, suggest that urgent measures must be taken to prevent the genetics erosion of the native guinea pigs of Ecuador and the rest of the Andean countries; It is necessary to design and implement recovery and conservation plans for guinea pigs in Ecuador to prevent the loss of this native genetic resource of South America.","",""

The population is estimated to be approximately 107 600, and the major ethnic community keeping this population is the Konso. Konso chickens are reared under scavenging management. Most of the cocks (43 percent) have red body plumage whereas brown (28 percent), zigrima (17 percent) and black (15 percent) are the prominent plumage colours in hens. About 4 percent of the cocks and less than 2 percent of the hens have naked necks. Both white (54 percent) and yellow (46 percent) skin colours exist. However, 56 percent of the cocks have yellow skin. The birds are mainly pea combed (49 percent) followed by a relatively large proportion of rose comb (22 percent). The shape of the head is mainly flat (45 percent); most of the chickens have blocky body shapes, although about 17 percent of the cocks and 13 percent of the hens have a triangular body shape. The average shank length of adult males is 10.1 cm and that of females is 7.1 cm. Adult males weigh about 1 411 g and females 1 011 g (Nigussie et al., 2010).","","Konso (Konso, Guji, Borana, Omo) "

Brown is the most predominant plumage in the population followed by red, white and kokima (white or grayish strips on brown or reddish background). Complete red is typical of males (38 percent of male plumage) but absent in females. Hens have all variants of colours including zigrima (24 percent), the most predominant, which is almost absent in males. The majority of males (about 40 percent) possess shining red back feathers that are entirely absent in females. Almost all chickens have normal feather distribution except a small proportion (3 percent) of naked neck chickens. The majority of the birds have white skin, regardless of sex, and most of the chickens are pea combed (55 percent). The average shank length of adult males is 8.4 cm and that of females is 7.1 cm.

Indeed it is impossible to speak of the Hergnies without mentioning the Braekel breed , a Belgian breed nowadays but which historically spread over Flanders (Belgian and French), part of Holland, the region of Hanover in Germany. The Hergnies did not pass the course of the second half of the 20th century, most certainly having caused confusion among the breeders of Braekel. Surprisingly, it was in Belgium that it was found (flowery color) to bring it back to life in the 1980s. In 1999, the Braekel-Hergnies club was created in relation with the Belgian Braekel-club, but the number of French breeders remain confidential.","",""

The Poitou breed is gradually absorbed by repeated crossings, in particular with the Flandrine breed , imported in the 17th century. by the Dutch during the drainage works of the Marais Poitevin. The latter, a good milkmaid, of high stature, improves the quality of the Sheep Poitevin, a vigorous animal with good processing potential. Crossbreeds between local breeds and the Southdown breed will make it possible to improve the beef qualities of the animals. Since the 1950s, breed have sought to select both maternal and beef skills. In 1967, the breed was officially approved by the Ministry of Agriculture. The majority of the workforce is located in the West and the Center of the country. HOW TO RECOGNIZE A SHEEP SHEEP? The Vendéen sheep can be recognized by its good butchery conformation, but above all by its particular mouse -gray head colour . The legs are the same colour as the head, which is covered by a square of wool.","Vendeen","Vendéen"

A single fertile, germ-free minipig pedigree has been established by choosing a small-sized minipigs strain, developing a pure lineage over decades and managing a population through the sterile management processes.","",""

It could be more precisely related to the Gascon. Within this brown branch, it is often attached to the fawn branch, and not to the alpine branch. She would then be the descendant of a breed that came from North Africa and arrived in Spain then in the southwest of France with the migration of the Arabs in the 7th century, just like the Parthenese which strongly resembles it, as well as the races nearby (Nantes and maraîchine). This would also explain its resemblance to various Spanish breeds.","",""

"Netherlands (Kingdom of the)","NLD","Ass","Mediterran Miniature","UK","Miniature Mediterranean Donkeys originated in the Mediterranean area of Northern Africa in ancient times and more recently from the Islands of Sicily and Sardinia off the west coast of Italy. Over time the distinctions between the two island populations blurred and they are now considered one breed properly called Miniature Mediterranean Donkeys. They are simply referred to as Miniature Donkeys in North America.  Purebred Miniature Donkeys in the Mediterranean area are rapidly disappearing as the small donkeys are being mixed with larger breeds. For this reason, Miniature Donkeys in North America have global genetic value. Fortunately, numbers in the U.S. and Canada are strong and are increasing since the first Miniature Donkeys arrived in the United States in the early 1900's. Within the past ten years the export of Miniature Donkeys to England, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Ireland, New Zealand and Australia has demonstrated the increasing popularity of these versatile, affectionate creatures. In 2014 the MDR now has over 65,500 registered donkeys.  The Miniature Donkey is a compact, well-proportioned animal with a sweet, sociable disposition. At maturity (3 years) it is able to pull a cart or carry a pack as it did in its native Sicily and Sardinia.  The Miniature Donkey community should strive to combine as many positive qualities as possible in each jennet and jack pairing to ensure the progeny will be excellent representatives of the breed.","Asino Sardo",""

The breed’s typical feature is, of course, the knob on the bird’s cranium. Even at birth it is clearly visible. The larger the knob, the larger the crest. The ideal crest is large and round, but does not cover the eyes. The cock's crest feathers should be narrow like the feathers of the neck and saddle, thus the crest is somewhat flattened at the front and the longest crest feathers will reach as far as the lower end of the wattles. The hen's crest feathers are rounder and shorter, thus enabling the crest to become large, round and serried. The breed has many colours, the crest is always white. Black-crested Whites are the exception but they have never been large in numbers although there is a small enthusiastic group of breeders trying to keep the breed.","","Polands (non bearded)"

However, the breed has been brought to the current degree of purity outside its country of origin. Leghorns of different types were selected in various countries, but they all have yellow shanks and white ear-lobes. The Leghorn belongs to the lightweight breeds.  The breed became famous for its exceptional egg laying ability. In the first half of the Twentieth Century it was the national breed in the Netherlands, when about 70% of the commercial poultry stock consisted of Leghorns. In the Fifties, the specially selected egg-producing breeds kept in professional poultry farming were replaced by hybrids. Poultry lovers, however, took over the task of caring for the Leghorn and are still preserving it today for future generations.  The Leghorn is called by names that differ from country to country. In the Netherlands, United States and Great Britain the breed is called Leghorn. In Italy, the country of origin, the breed is called Livorno; Belgium has also adopted the name Livorno which coexists together with the name in use in German speaking countries, which is Italiener (German for ‘Italian’). Since Belgium is also a French-speaking country, the French name “Leghorn type moderne” (Italiener type) is another denomination being used in the country. However, in German speaking countries the name Leghorn is specific for the American Leghorn.  The Dutch type is rather elongated in shape, but also very strong in its appearance. The general appearance is that of a slender bird, with broad shoulders that become progressively narrower towards the tail. The eyes are orange red. The cock’s single comb stands up erect, while the hen’s comb’s blade is lopped and falls over on one side. The rose comb variation is also recognised. The comb spike is protruding backwards. The cock weighs between 2.5 and 3.5 kg, the hen between 2.25 and 2,75 kg. The bantam cock will weigh 700 to 800 g and the bantam hen will be 600 to 700 g.

Unfortunately, by the end of World War II, when dwindling duck stocks left the Kooikerhondje out of a job, the breed almost became extinct. In all it is thought only 25 Kooikerhondjes were left in existence. In 1939 Baroness Van Hardenbroek van Ammerstol decided to resurrect the little Kooikerhondje. For generations, the Kooikerhondje was used in an ingenious method of hunting ducks. The hunter would build a trap called a ""Kooi"" which consists of a curved ditch leading out from a pond frequented by ducks. Over the ditch an arch of netting is suspended. The result is a pipe through which the ducks could enter but could not see the end of. The Kooikerhondje's job was to lure the ducks far enough down the pipe so the hunter could cut off their retreat and drive them to the trap at the end.","Kooiker dog",""

In the beginning of the 20th century Swiss goats were imported to improve milk and meat production of the landrace goats. The Dutch Toggenburg goat has its history in Drenthe. In this province the local landrace goat was crossed with the Swiss Toggenburg goat. In 1938 the Dutch Toggenburg breed was officially established. Typical is the color of milkchocolate, the pattern and the compact type. In the other provinces of the Netherlands the local landrace goats were crossed with Swiss Saanen goats, that resulted in the Dutch White goat. In the province Zeeland breeders preferred the coloured goat more than the white and this resulted in the Dutch Pied original goat. Only two-coloured animals are accepted (black-white or brown-white) by the breed society. Sometimes the Dutch White goat is used for improvement of the offspring of the Dutch Pied original. In the late 80s of the previous century a tremendous growth in professional dairy goat farming took place in the Netherlands. The majority of the Dutch milk goats is not registered in a herd book, the origin of these Dutch Milkgoat is the Dutch White goat, with a dash of foreign blood (Nubian, Alpine, Saanen).

At this time there are about 40,000 Friesian horses registered. The Friesian horse is a purebred horse native to the Netherlands. Its roots go far back in time. The Friesian horse was recognized as early as the 13th century, and Friesian horses of today still display definite similarities with their distant ancestors. The breed's long history and a consistent breeding policy have consolidated the specific 'Friesian' characteristics. On this sturdy foundation, the Friesian horse has evolved into what it is today: an imposing presence in every respect.  With its black colour, long mane and full tail, the Friesian is recognizable in an instant. The horse has an elegant build and powerful, elevated gaits. Its character is friendly and graciously spirited. All of these qualities make the Friesian a fine horse that can be used for many different purposes.  The Friesian horse is being successfully – and above all, very enthusiastically – employed in various equestrian sports. The specific Friesian qualities are displayed especially well in driving competitions where they can be seen in action before the gig, in the single horse and pairs classes as well as in the unicorn and show cart categories. Competing for the highest honours, these black horses are making themselves very well known.  The Friesian horse is also a fine dressage horse. Its fine self-carriage, willingness to work and inquisitive nature make it perfect for this branch of the sport. Friesians are now increasingly being seen at national competitions where they are displaying their talents to compete on equal terms with all other horses bred for riding purposes. Friesian horses are just as well represented in driving trials and marathon tests. And, last but certainly not least, one can scarcely imagine a more enjoyable partner as a recreational horse than the Friesian.  After the critical period in the 1960s, the tide has turned and the Friesian horse has done nothing but gain in popularity and appreciation. This year, the number of foals born was around 6000, and this number is increasing every year. These larger numbers are giving the FPS an opportunity to be stricter in its selections and in this way to bring the average quality of the horses' conformation and usefulness to a higher plane. In 2009 about 26000 animals in the Netherlands and about 7000 foals were born each year. In 2017 3656 foals were born.   Schurink, A.; Arts, J.A.J.; Ducro, B.J.

BREED HISTORY The true origin of the PRE is not an exact science; what is known is that in the pre-Roman era, there were already references to horses in what is today known as Spain. Roman authors such as Plutarch, Pliny the Old and Seneca spoke of the Hispanic horse as a beautiful, docile, arrogant and brave horse, ideal for war and for the sports that were carried out in the circuses at that time. During the reign of King Philip II, the equine realm of his Kingdom was organized, laying down the final bases so that the PRE was able to reach its peak during subsequent years. This was possible with the creation of the Royal Stables in Cordoba, where he gathered together the best stallions and mares from all the provinces bordering the Guadalquivir River, which at that time, were the most productive in the breeding of horses. Thus, the Royal Stud Farm was created, which after time became known as the National Stud Farm. A multitude of horses were exported to the American continents; these horses played a decisive role on its exploration, and were the origin and basis for most of the breeds that have subsequently been bred in America. In Europe, Spain was enjoying its Golden Age. At that time, the most treasured gift from a Spanish monarch was one of the nation’s magnificent horses. Spanish horses soon earned repute and were decisive in the birth of many Central European breeds. Breeds such as the Lipizzaner, Lusitano, Paso Fino and the Central European Warmbloods all owe their ancestry to the PRE. There are currently about 170,000 PRE horses throughout the whole world, bred in more than 60 countries.","Purebred Spanish",""

A mature ewe weighs 75 kilos on average and stands 68 centimetres at the withers. The Texel Sheep is a medium sized sheep, that lambs once a year. Adult ewes usually birth and suckle two lambs per litter. Ewes can have their first litter at 12 months. The Texel Sheep is of very good meat quality, with excellent fat deposition. A Texel Sheep is large-framed, has a solid square stance and looks bigger than its actual size. Its head is characteristic and well-proportioned with a straight nasal bridge and a wide mouth. The head is covered with fine white hair, in contrast to the black nose. Its neck is long and in proportion. The body has pronounced muscling with well-developed loins and thighs. The forehand, middle and hind quarters are evenly proportioned. The Texel Sheep’s forehand is broad and deep, with well-positioned and reasonably long shoulders and a breastbone extending sufficiently to the front. Its middle piece is long and broad with sufficient depth in the ribs and broad, strong loins. The hindquarters are broad, while the croup is long and lightly sloped. The legs have a delicate structure, are dry and powerful, and are positioned correctly when walking or standing. Its wool is fine, dense and doesn’t contain excess lanolin. The rump is covered in a white coat. Both head and legs aren’t covered with wool but with fine white hair. The tail is thin and of appropriate length.  HISTORY  Origins of the Texel Sheep  The Texel Sheep was bred over a hundred years ago as a crossbreed from indigenous marsh sheep and several British breeds, such as Leicester, Wensleydale and Lincoln. This resulted in a large, fast-growing and woolly sheep. Through effective selection, this breed of sheep has become the most heavily muscled meat sheep in the world. The Texel Sheep is a breed in which excellent carcass quality and great prolific qualities come together.  The Netherlands has a long history of sheep farming. Approximately 1.5 million sheep are kept on about 20,000 farms. Specialist sheep farms have over 300 ewes. Most sheep are held in dairy farms as a secondary activity, with ewes lambing in spring. Breeding, reproduction and meat farming is mainly integrated in the company’s activities. Sheep are mainly kept for meat production. The profitability of sheep farming is determined by lamb production, growth rate and meat quality.  Over the past few decades, sheep farmers have invested a lot of money in research on increasing the profitability of their businesses. By using rams with superior genetic traits, great progress has been made in further improving the functional exterior features and carcass composition. Where in the past the emphasis was on meat and wool production, the main goal of today is the sales of slaughter lambs of a consistent, high quality.","","Texel sheep"

However there are by now a number of flocks located well outside the traditional boundaries. They are a mountain breed that has adapted to the harsh winters within their natural surroundings. They are also equally at home on low-lying ground. They have a quiet temperament and make excellent, careful mothers. They lamb easily, have a plentiful milk supply and defend their young. The lambs have a strong desire to live, grow quickly and develop to form the quality of carcase demanded by the current market. Lambing is predominantly outside in March with a successful 150% ratio easily achieved. The draft ewe is much in demand to produce the Welsh Mule through crossing with the Blue Faced Leicester and is equally successful when crossed with other terminal sires. The majority of purebred lamb carcasses weigh between 16 –18kg with crossbred lambs exceeding 20kg. In general most ewes weigh between 60 – 70kg with the rams tipping the scales at 80 – 100kg.","Welsh Hill Speckled Face",""

They are riverine type and are good milk yielder (Neopane et al., 1999). Besides milk, they are also used for meat, power and manure. People of the far western region produce butter fat from the milk of buffaloes and sell them to the adjoining territory of India. It is one of the major sources of income for the people of the region. Gaddi buffaloes are widely distributed in an area of 5482 Km2 ranging from an elevation of 1500 to 4500 masl where temperature varies from 18.8oC in winter to 28 oC in summer. Annual rainfall in these location ranges from 860 mm to 1242 mm. Out of 101,500 total buffaloes in the area, Gaddi are reported to be only 16,000. Their population is declining at a faster rate and the pure breed males are rarely found.","",""

Hutsul, as one of the oldest breeds described in Poland and still in existence today, undoubtedly deserved to be included in the protection program. The first program for the protection of genetic resources of Hutsul horses was developed in 1999, and in 2000 was adopted by the Ministry of Agriculture as formally binding (http://www.bioroznorodnosc.izoo.krakow.pl/konie).","Hutsul","Hucul Horse, Hutsul, Konie Huculskie"

This process was most evident in the lands of Malopolska, which at that time covered huge areas of southeastern Poland, from Krakow - to the borders of the Turkish Empire. The dominant influence of the oriental sires continued through the 17th, 18th, and first half of the 19th centuries. As a result, a cross-section of the domestic herd took on the character of an oriental half-breed. Beginning in the second half of the 19th century, the influence of English thoroughbreds became apparent, both in pure form and through various strains of half-bloods. However, the influence of oriental horses was still very strong. A particularly important role began to be played by oriental half-blood lines of Austro-Hungarian origin, shaped on a similar basis as the former Polish horses, under the influence of similar blood currents, in similar natural conditions. The influence of pure Arabian blood horses also intensified. The interpenetration of Arabian and English blood currents made half-blooded Anglo-Arabians the dominant type of horse in Malopolska","",""

"Romania","ROU","Buffalo","Romanian Buffalo","","The buffalo is a species perfect integrated in the climatic conditions of Romania. The growth area of buffalos in Romania is characterized by specific habitat conditions that differ from the cattle. The relief is variable depending on the growth center (relief of hill in Transylvania and relief of plain and even swamps along the Danube). The soils are poorly evolved, clay-iluvional structure (of acid reaction) and hydromorphic soils. The natural fertility of the soil is generally low. The natural vegetation has low nutritional value, it comes from low productive pastures, on the edge of rivers or on communal pastures.","Mediterranean","Bivol Romaneasc"

These were distributed along the central plateau, which was a Tsetse fly free zone, and were almost exclusively of the SANGA type. Characteristically, they: - were neck-humped - had a small stature - were rounded in appearance with sloping rumps - had sleek and shiny coats - were fine bone structured - had small, broad and alert heads - had long, thin active tails - had horns in cows which curved outwards and forwards, and were round and fine in cross-section - had horns in bulls which were also rounded but shorter and heavier, curving out and upwards - had horns in oxen which were longer and more widespread - were predominantly black in colour, followed by reds and browns, with yellows and duns being less common - had coat colours were often accompanied by white patches or stipples very broken in outline - frequently had black and red colour mixing giving rise to variations of attractive M’Sundu pattern or more rarely brindle (Nhuru)","Mashona","Amanjanja, Makaranga, Ngombe Dza Vakaranga, Shona, Ngombe Dza Maswina"
